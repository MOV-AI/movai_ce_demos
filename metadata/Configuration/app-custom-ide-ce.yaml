      "Purpose: Simple Husky robot navigation using wheel odometry feedback.
      Simulator world: husky_depot (Launch the world before running the flow).
      Detail: The robot moves in a square path of 2mx2m. As time progresses the path shifts due to the accumulative error from the wheel odometry feedback."

      Visualization tool: RVIZ (Launch the rviz before running the flow. Select the Visualize Map group on the left menu).
      Detail: Use the Command Line property of the map server node on the flow to select the map to be visualized. Visualize the saved map after mapping a scene. In rviz enable the visualize map group on the left menu to view the map. The default map name is new_map. Use the command line property of the map_server to alter the map name to be visualized."

      Detail: The robot moves between three locations of the depot map autonomously repeatedly. This flow is a demo for autonomous navigation  using husky robot. We use the depot map combined with amcl and ekf to localize and move_base combined with the global planner and teb local planner as well as the global costmap and local cost map to navigate the robot. In the flow, the go_to node is used to send a goal to the move_base. Once localized the robot will move to a preset location in the map, which can be configured using the parameters of the go_to node."
