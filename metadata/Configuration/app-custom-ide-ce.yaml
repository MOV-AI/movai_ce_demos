      "Purpose: Simple Husky robot navigation using wheel odometry feedback.
      Simulator world: husky_depot (Launch the world before running the flow).
      Detail: The robot moves is a sqare path of 2mx2m. As time progresses the path shifts due to the accumulative error from the wheel odometry feedback."
